<h1>Ontology Builder/Mapper README</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Ontology Builder/Mapper is a tool for building an ontology and/or creating mappings between your ontology and the TRIPS ontology.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Add/remove concepts in your ontology.
 <li>Rearrange concepts in your ontology into a tree by dragging them.
 <li>Edit your concept details:
  <ul>
   <li>name
   <li>comment
   <li>roles
   <li>words
   <li>examples
  </ul>
 <li>Add/remove mappings between TRIPS concepts and your concepts.
 <li>Add/remove mappings between the roles of a TRIPS concept (and their fillers' roles in turn, etc.) and the roles of your concept, when the concepts are mapped.
 <li>Add/remove mappings between specific TRIPS role filler types, and the roles of your concept, when the concepts are mapped.
 <li>Add/remove extra roles in TRIPS concepts.
 <li>Search for concepts by name in TRIPS ontology or your ontology.
 <li>Load/save your ontology and mappings as JSON.
 <li>Display mappings between concepts that aren't visible because that part of the tree is collapsed, as if they were mappings between their nearest visible ancestors, except partially transparent.
 <li>Autocomplete concept search boxes.
 <li>Autocomplete role filler type/path boxes.
 <li>Word counts next to each concept show how many words under that concept are also under the selected concept on the other side.
 <li>Inheritance of:
  <ul>
   <li>Original TRIPS roles, and their restrictions
   <!-- li>Extra TRIPS roles (WIP) -->
   <li>TRIPS role filler types/paths (WIP)
   <li>your roles
   <li>role mappings (WIP)
  </ul>
  Inherited things are gray instead of black.
</ul>

<h4>Planned Features</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Display mappings between TRIPS concepts and WordNet senses in the TRIPS concept details, and use them as extra words for the word count feature.
 <li>Extend mapping lines into tree views, up to the name of the concept.
 <li>Export to/import from other formats, e.g. DSL, OWL.
</ul>

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<ul>
 <li>There are gaps on the right and bottom sides of the map panes.
 <li>Tree nodes remain selected even after they are hidden because an ancestor was collapsed.
 <li>It's possible to map roles when the corresponding concepts aren't mapped yet (maybe that should cause the concepts to be mapped, and conversely removing a concept mapping should remove the role mappings too).
 <li>Inheritance bugs:
  <ul>
   <li>Role mappings are only inherited on your side, not the TRIPS side.
   <li>Extra TRIPS roles aren't inherited.
   <li>Role filler types/paths are only inherited if you never showed the descendant concept's details before adding the inherited parts to the ancestor concept.
   <li>Similarly, some inherited extra TRIPS stuff may not appear inherited after a load, because it gets added after inheritance is computed.
   <li>Role filler types/paths are only inherited if they were initially defined on a non-inherited role.
  </ul>
 <li>Load/save bugs:
  <ul>
   <li>Once I saw it save a file with an empty <code>"rolePath"</code> field (which it then rightly refuses to load), but I wasn't able to reproduce the problem, and I don't see how it's even possible.
   <li>If a load fails, the program may be left in an inconsistent state, rather than the state it was in before the load was attempted. Extra things added to the TRIPS side may be deleted, even though mappings may still depend on them. Workaround: reload the page.
   <li>If the word count feature is somehow triggered after a file load but before the UI is finished updating, it may be put into an inconsistent state.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The interface is divided into a grid of three sections horizontally by two sections vertically, like this:</p>
<table>
<tr><th rowspan="2" class="meta top left"></th><th colspan="2" class="meta top">TRIPS ontology</th><th class="meta top">mappings</th><th colspan="2" class="meta top">your ontology</th></tr>
<tr><th colspan="3">Ontology Builder/Mapper (<a href="#">help</a>)</th><th><button>load</button> <button>save</button></th><th>concept: <button>+</button> <button>-</button></th></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="2" class="meta left">trees</th><th>TRIPS ontology</th><td>search for concept</td><th>map: <button>+</button> <button>-</button></th><th>Your ontology</th><td>search for concept</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2" class="pane">[TRIPS tree view]</td><td class="pane">[concept mappings]</td><td colspan="2" class="pane">[your tree view]</td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="2" class="meta left">details/roles</th><th colspan="2">TRIPS concept details</th><th>map: <button>+</button> <button>-</button></th><th colspan="2">Your concept details</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2" class="pane">[TRIPS concept detail view]</td><td class="pane">[role mappings]</td><td colspan="2" class="pane">[your concept detail view]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <button>+</button> and <button>-</button> buttons add and remove things. The pair of buttons labeled "concept" at the top right add and remove concepts in your ontology. The pairs labeled "map" in the middle add and remove mappings between the TRIPS ontology and your ontology. The top middle pair (in the trees row) add and remove mappings between the selected <em>concepts</em>, and the bottom middle pair (in the details/roles row) add and remove mappings between the selected <em>roles</em>. Role mappings are specific to the concepts the roles are in (but see Planned Features). Mappings appear in the middle column as lines drawn between the mapped concepts/roles. Mappings between concepts hidden because that part of the tree is collapsed are drawn between their nearest visible ancestors, and are partially transparent. You can also drag between the black spots in the mappings column to add mappings.</p>

<p>Each side of the trees section has a search box at the top right. Enter the name of a concept to search for it in the ontology on that side. If found, its ancestors will be expanded, it will be selected, and it will scroll into view. If not, an alert will appear.</p>

<p>Create some concepts by clicking the concept <button>+</button> button and entering a name for each one in your concept detail view. Then you can drag them around the tree view in order to form a hierarchy. You can select multiple concepts at once by holding the shift or control keys, and then you can drag the whole selection as a unit. You can expand or collapse concept nodes in the tree views either by clicking on the arrow to the left of the concept, or by double-clicking the concept itself. It is also possible to navigate the tree views using the keyboard: up/down arrows move the cursor, left/right arrows collapse/expand the concept under the cursor, or move up/down the hierarchy, and enter selects the concept under the cursor.</p>

<p>Selected things are <span class="selected">highlighted in blue</span> (the cursor and the selection are separate, though they look similar; the cursor is <span class="cursor">lighter blue</span>). When exactly one concept is selected in the tree view, its details are displayed in the corresponding concept detail view:</p>
<dl>
 <dt class="inline">name<dd><var>the name of the concept</var>
 <dt>comment<dd><var class="comment">comments about the concept</var>
 <dt>roles<dd><ul class="selectable">
  <li>role/restriction 1
  <li class="selected">role/restriction 2
  <li class="inherited">inherited role/restriction 3
  <li>...
  <li class="controls"><button>+</button> <button>-</button>
 </ul>
 <dt class="inline">words<dd><var>words associated with the concept</var>
 <dt>examples<dd><ul>
  <li><var>example sentence using the words</var>
  <li>...
  <li class="controls"><button>+</button> <button>-</button>
 </ul>
</dl>

<p>All of your concept details are editable. Fields that are required but not yet filled are <span class="invalid">highlighted in pink</span>.</p>

<p>The optional words field enables you to easily see which concepts share words between the TRIPS ontology and your ontology. When a concept in one ontology is selected, and it has words associated with it, each concept in the other ontology displays how many of those words (if any) are associated with it, next to its node in the tree view. If the node is collapsed, the words associated with its hidden descendants are also included. Each word is counted only once, even if it is associated with multiple descendants. If you place your mouse cursor over the number, a tooltip will appear, showing you which words are shared.</p>

<p>Extra roles and role filler types/paths are the only things that are editable in the TRIPS concept details. Any role in TRIPS may be added to a TRIPS concept for the purpose of mapping it to a role in your concept. Extra roles that aren't mapped aren't saved.</p>

<p>Role filler types may be added to each TRIPS role for the purpose of mapping them to your roles. The intended meaning of such mappings is that the TRIPS role will only be mapped to your role if the term that fills it is of the given type. The type must be a TRIPS concept name.</p>

<p>In the same field, you may also specify a path through roles, and optionally filler types, to the term that should be used to fill your role. Items in the path should be separated by commas and/or spaces, and role names should have a <code>:</code> prefix to distinguish them from concept names. For example, say you have a TRIPS term graph where a term of type <code>foo</code> has a role <code>:bar</code>, filled by another term of type <code>baz</code>, which in turn has a role <code>:qux</code>. And say you have mapped <code>foo</code> to your concept <code>fred</code>, but you want <code>:qux</code> to be mapped to your role <code>:glarch</code> in this situation. Then you would click the <button>+</button> under the <code>:bar</code> role in <code>foo</code>'s details, enter <code>baz :qux</code> in the box that appears, and map that new line (instead of the whole <code>:bar</code> role) to your role <code>:glarch</code> in your concept <code>fred</code>.</p>

<p>Click the <button>save</button> button above your ontology to save your ontology and mappings to a file on your computer, in the JSON format (see below). (Safari and IE users: this might just open the file in the browser instead, so you will then have to use your browser's "save as" function, and save only the page source and not a web archive/complete webpage. IE users: upgrade to Edge. Safari users: complain to Apple and tell them to implement the <code>download</code> attribute.) Click the <button>load</button> button to the left of the <button>save</button> button to load such a file back into the page.</p>

<h2>JSON Save Format</h2>
<p>Shown below is the structure of the save file generated when you click the <button>save</button> button. Variables are <var>highlighted in green</var>. All fields are required except <code>"parent"</code> and <code>"fillerType"</code>, but some may be empty. If <code>"parent"</code> is omitted, the concept will be a top-level concept.</p>

<code><pre>
{
	"ontologySaveDate": "<var>date and time that the <button>save</button> button was clicked</var>",
	"<var>your concept name</var>": {
		"comment": "<var>comment</var>",
