<h1>Ontology Builder/Mapper README</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Ontology Builder/Mapper is a tool for building an ontology and/or creating mappings between your ontology and the TRIPS ontology.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Add/remove concepts in your ontology.
 <li>Rearrange concepts in your ontology into a tree by dragging them.
 <li>Edit your concept details:
  <ul>
   <li>name
   <li>comment
   <li>roles
   <li>words
   <li>examples
  </ul>
 <li>Add/remove mappings and associated things:
  <ul>
   <li>Mappings between one or more TRIPS concepts and one of your concepts.
   <li>Mappings between the roles of a TRIPS concept (and their fillers' roles in turn, etc.; autocompleted) and the roles of your concept, as part of a concept mapping.
   <li>Mappings between specific TRIPS role filler types, and the roles of your concept, as part of a concept mapping.
   <li>Use "nil" filler type in a concept mapping, to indicate TRIPS roles that must not be filled for the mapping to apply.
   <li>Extra roles in TRIPS concepts.
   <li>Mappings between TRIPS roles/paths and your role filler <em>values</em> (not types, not paths)
   <li>Multiple concept mappings for a given pair of concepts, with different role mappings (and associated role filler types and extra roles).
  </ul>
 <li>Search for concepts by name in TRIPS ontology or your ontology (with autocomplete).
 <li>Load/save your ontology and mappings as JSON.
 <li>Add a prefix to all concepts/roles in your ontology.
 <li>Mappings between concepts that aren't visible because that part of the tree is collapsed, are displayed as if they were mappings between their nearest visible ancestors, except partially transparent.
 <li>Role mapping lines for different concept mappings for the same pair of concepts are color-coded and displayed together.
 <li>Word counts next to each concept show how many words under that concept are also under the selected concept on the other side.
 <li>Inheritance of original TRIPS roles and their restrictions, and of your roles (inherited things are gray instead of black).
 <li>Build Lisp mapping rules for use in TRIPS, optionally posting them for anyone to use with the web parsers.
</ul>

<h4>Planned Features</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Display mappings between TRIPS concepts and WordNet senses in the TRIPS concept details, and use them as extra words for the word count feature.
 <li>Extend mapping lines into tree views, up to the name of the concept.
</ul>

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<ul>
 <li>There are gaps on the right and bottom sides of the map panes.
 <li>Tree nodes remain selected even after they are hidden because an ancestor was collapsed.
 <li>If the word count feature is somehow triggered after a file load but before the UI is finished updating, it may be put into an inconsistent state.
 <li>If you make multiple role mappings from the same TRIPS role filler type/path, save, and then load, there will instead be separate copies of the same path, one for each role mapping.
 <li>The order that extra trips roles and paths are redisplayed in is not the order in which they were added, but rather the order in which the first role mappings using them were added. So if you add stuff to a TRIPS concept, map it, and move to a different TRIPS concept and back again, the stuff you added may appear in a different order.
 <li>The state of the "optional" checkbox and the dashedness of the selected role mapping line can be out of sync when the role mapping is first added. If this happens, you can check and uncheck the checkbox a few times to be sure which it is.
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The interface is divided into a grid of three sections horizontally by two sections vertically, like this:</p>
<table>
<tr><th rowspan="2" class="meta top left"></th><th colspan="2" class="meta top">TRIPS ontology</th><th class="meta top">mappings</th><th colspan="2" class="meta top">your ontology</th></tr>
<tr><th colspan="2">Ontology Builder/Mapper (<a href="#">help</a>)</th><th><button>build rules</button> <input type="checkbox" checked> post</th><th><button>load</button> <button>save</button> prefix: <span class="input">your prefix</span></th><th>concept: <button>+</button> <button>-</button></th></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="2" class="meta left">trees</th><th>TRIPS ontology</th><td>search for concept</td><th>map: <button>+</button> <button>-</button> <select><option>1</option></select></th><th>Your ontology</th><td>search for concept</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2" class="pane">[TRIPS tree view]</td><td class="pane">[concept mappings]</td><td colspan="2" class="pane">[your tree view]</td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="2" class="meta left">details/roles</th><th colspan="2">TRIPS concept details</th><th>map: <button>+</button> <button>-</button></th><th colspan="2">Your concept details</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2" class="pane">[TRIPS concept detail view]</td><td class="pane">[role mappings]</td><td colspan="2" class="pane">[your concept detail view]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <button>+</button> and <button>-</button> buttons add and remove things. The pair of buttons labeled "concept" at the top right add and remove concepts in your ontology. The pairs labeled "map" in the middle add and remove mappings between the TRIPS ontology and your ontology. The top middle pair (in the trees row) add and remove mappings between the selected <em>concepts</em>, and the bottom middle pair (in the details/roles row) add and remove mappings between the selected <em>roles</em>. Mappings appear in the middle column as lines drawn between the mapped concepts/roles. Mappings between concepts hidden because that part of the tree is collapsed are drawn between their nearest visible ancestors, and are partially transparent. You can also drag between the black spots in the mappings column (drag handles) to add mappings.</p>

<p>Role mappings are specific to the currently selected concept mapping. You may make multiple concept mappings for a given pair of concepts, with different sets of role mappings. Use the selection box to the right of the concept map <button>-</button> button to switch between different concept mappings for the selected pair of concepts. Role mapping lines for all the concept mappings between the selected pair of concepts are displayed at once. But they are color coded according to the concept mapping they are a part of, as are the entries in the selection box, and the heading above the role mappings section.</p>

<p>Role mappings may be optional or required. An optional role mapping is displayed with a dashed line, and when the role mapping is selected, the checkbox labeled "optional" is checked. You can change the optionality of a role mapping by checking or unchecking this checkbox when it is selected.</p>

<p>Each side of the trees section has a search box at the top right. Enter the name of a concept to search for it in the ontology on that side. If found, its ancestors will be expanded, it will be selected, and it will scroll into view. If not, an alert will appear.</p>

<p>Create some concepts by clicking the concept <button>+</button> button and entering a name for each one in your concept detail view. Then you can drag them around the tree view in order to form a hierarchy. You can select multiple concepts at once by holding the shift or control keys, and then you can drag the whole selection as a unit. You can expand or collapse concept nodes in the tree views either by clicking on the arrow to the left of the concept, or by double-clicking the concept itself. It is also possible to navigate the tree views using the keyboard: up/down arrows move the cursor, left/right arrows collapse/expand the concept under the cursor, or move up/down the hierarchy, and enter selects the concept under the cursor.</p>

<p>Selected things are <span class="selected">highlighted in blue</span> (the cursor and the selection are separate, though they look similar; the cursor is <span class="cursor">lighter blue</span>). When exactly one concept is selected in the tree view, its details are displayed in the corresponding concept detail view:</p>
<dl>
 <dt class="inline">name<dd><var>the name of the concept</var>
 <dt>comment<dd><var class="comment">comments about the concept</var>
 <dt>roles<dd><ul class="selectable">
  <li>role/restriction 1
  <li class="selected">role/restriction 2
  <li class="inherited">inherited role/restriction 3
  <li>...
  <li class="controls"><button>+</button> <button>-</button>
 </ul>
 <dt class="inline">words<dd><var>words associated with the concept</var>
 <dt>examples<dd><ul>
  <li><var>example sentence using the words</var>
  <li>...
  <li class="controls"><button>+</button> <button>-</button>
 </ul>
</dl>

<p>All of your concept details are editable. Fields that are required but not yet filled are <span class="invalid">highlighted in pink</span>.</p>

<p>The optional words field enables you to easily see which concepts share words between the TRIPS ontology and your ontology. When a concept in one ontology is selected, and it has words associated with it, each concept in the other ontology displays how many of those words (if any) are associated with it, next to its node in the tree view. If the node is collapsed, the words associated with its hidden descendants are also included. Each word is counted only once, even if it is associated with multiple descendants. If you place your mouse cursor over the number, a tooltip will appear, showing you which words are shared.</p>

<p>There are three things that are editable in the TRIPS concept details, but they are actually part of the selected concept mapping. They are: other mapped TRIPS concepts, extra roles, and role filler types/paths.</p>

<p>If you add a (comma and/or space separated) list of other TRIPS concept names in the "other mapped TRIPS concepts" field, and you have a concept mapping selected, those other concepts will also be mapped using the same concept mapping to the same concept in your ontology. If you enter something in this field before the concept mapping is created, it will not be saved.</p>

<p>Any role in TRIPS may be added to a TRIPS concept for the purpose of mapping it to a role in your concept. If you fail to add a mapping for an extra role before saving or selecting a different concept mapping or concept, the extra role will not be saved.</p>

<p>Role filler types may be added to each TRIPS role for the purpose of mapping them to your roles. The intended meaning of such mappings is that the TRIPS role will only be mapped to your role if the term that fills it is of the given type. The type must be a TRIPS concept name.</p>

<p>In the same field, you may also specify a path through roles, and optionally filler types, to the term that should be used to fill your role. Items in the path should be separated by commas and/or spaces, and role names should have a <code>:</code> prefix to distinguish them from concept names. For example, say you have a TRIPS term graph where a term of type <code>foo</code> has a role <code>:bar</code>, filled by another term of type <code>baz</code>, which in turn has a role <code>:qux</code>. And say you have mapped <code>foo</code> to your concept <code>fred</code>, but you want <code>:qux</code> to be mapped to your role <code>:glarch</code> in this situation. Then you would click the <button>+</button> under the <code>:bar</code> role in <code>foo</code>'s details, enter <code>baz :qux</code> in the box that appears, and map that new line (instead of the whole <code>:bar</code> role) to your role <code>:glarch</code> in your concept <code>fred</code>.</p>

<p>The last role filler type may be <code>nil</code>. This indicates that the role must <em>not</em> be filled for the concept mapping to apply. Role paths ending with <code>nil</code> may not be mapped to one of your roles. To indicate which concept mapping such a path is part of, its drag handle is color coded. Role paths not ending with <code>nil</code> must be mapped before saving or moving to a different concept or concept mapping, or they will not be saved (same as extra roles).</p>

<p>There is a similar field you can add under one of your roles, but with slightly different semantics. It holds a single <em>value</em> (not a type, and not a path) to fill the role with instead of the value from the TRIPS side of the role mapping. For example, if you mapped the TRIPS path <code>color-val :value red</code> directly to your role <code>color-value</code>, it would end up being filled by the term of type <code>ONT::red</code>. But if you instead added the role filler value <code>red</code> under your role, and mapped to that, your role would be filled by that simple value rather than by the term.</p>

<p>If you add several role filler types under a single TRIPS role, and mark all of their role mappings optional, it is taken to mean that only one of those role filler types may be used at a time. It is possible to avoid this interpretation by adding the same TRIPS role more than once, and putting each role filler type under a different instance of the TRIPS role. It's also possible to mix the two options. For example, you could add two <code>:mod</code> roles, adding color-related filler types to the first and size-related filler types to the second. Then only one size <code>:mod</code> and only one color <code>:mod</code> would be allowed, but you could still have both a size and a color. (This one-of restriction helps us make the rule engine fast while keeping the generated rule set small.)</p>

<p>Click the <button>save</button> button above your ontology to save your ontology and mappings to a file on your computer, in the JSON format (see below). (Safari and IE users: this might just open the file in the browser instead, so you will then have to use your browser's "save as" function, and save only the page source and not a web archive/complete webpage. IE users: upgrade to Edge. Safari users: complain to Apple and tell them to implement the <code>download</code> attribute.) Click the <button>load</button> button to the left of the <button>save</button> button to load such a file back into the page.</p>

<p>If you want a prefix to be added to all the concept and role names in your ontology, enter it in the box labeled "prefix" to the right of the <button>save</button> button before saving. This is useful for adding a Lisp package to these symbols, for example entering "foo::" (or "foo"; the "::" will be added) in this field will put all symbols in the "foo" package. The prefix won't otherwise show up in the GUI, to avoid clutter.</p>

<p>Click the <button>build rules</button> button at the top middle to build a set of extraction rules in the Lisp format usable by TRIPS. If you leave the "post" checkbox next to it checked, your rule set will be made available to the TRIPS web parsers, for anyone to use. Either way, submitting the form will download the Lisp file to your computer. The file will be named using the prefix followed by "RuleSet.lisp", so the prefix must be specified, and must only contain letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens (with an optional "::" suffix, which will be removed for the filename).</p>

<h2>JSON Save Format</h2>
<p>Shown below is the structure of the save file generated when you click the <button>save</button> button. Variables are <var>highlighted in green</var>. All fields are required except <code>"parent"</code>, <code>"fillerType"</code>, and <code>"roleId"</code>, but some may be empty. If <code>"parent"</code> is omitted, the concept will be a top-level concept. Note that the first element of <code>"rolePathMappings"</code> below is an example of a normal mapped role, while the second is an example of a "nil" role filler type, which is not mapped to one of your roles. The presence of <code>"optional"</code> at the start of the first indicates that the role mapping is optional, its absence would indicate that the role mapping is required. The first role mapping is also an example of a mapping to a filler value of one of your roles, because it ends with <code>"<var>your role filler value</var>"</code>. Mappings directly to one of your roles only have one string at the end, <code>"<var>your role name</var>"</code>. Paths ending with a step with <code>"fillerType": "nil"</code> are never optional, and never have your role name or your role filler value (because they aren't mapped). The <code>"roleId"</code> field may appear on the first step of a path, and distinguishes between different instances of the same TRIPS role in the same concept mapping.</p>
